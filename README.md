# Elilang
Elilang is a framework, still in beta version. Elilang allows you to simplify working with Elixir on mobile devices when using Termux, or something else. It also removes the need for root rights. Elilang removes dependency on Node.js by using Golang instead of Node.js. Compatible with Phoenix framework.
